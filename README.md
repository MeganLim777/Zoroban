# Zoroban

Zoroban is a mental arithmetic training app. It helps to train a person's mental arithmetic skills by generating random questions and the user has to give the right answer. 

The questions are targeted towards addition, subtraction, multiplication or division depending on what the user feels like they need to focus on. They can also customize how difficult they want the question to be by changing the amount of levels and the amount of digits used. If the user is struggling to visualize the soroban abacus inside their head, they can use the virtual soroban available inside the app.

## What is mental arithmetic
It is, as the name suggests, doing arithmetic in your head. Yes, we could use a calculator to get the answer. But personally I feel that doing these calculations in my head keeps the brain more active rather than just relying on a computer to do it for me.

## Why I have created this app
I used to take mental arithmetic tuition when I was younger and I felt that it really helped me in maths class in school and therefore gain confidence for high school and uni. However, over these past few years I felt that my brain had become slower when trying to do even the more easier calculations. I didn't want to lose this skill, or else why I go through all those tuitions right? ;) 

So, I created this app to generate random questions to help train my brain and I can choose the question's difficulty and choose whether I want to focus on addition, subtraction, multiplication or division.
